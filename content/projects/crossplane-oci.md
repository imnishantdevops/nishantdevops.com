title: "Declarative Infrastructure on OCI using Crossplane"
---

### Problem
Traditional infrastructure provisioning was slow, manual, and environment-specific.

### Solution
Built a **platform engineering POC** using **Crossplane on OCI**, managing cloud resources via Kubernetes CRDs.

### What I Did
- Provisioned OCI networking and compute declaratively
- Integrated infrastructure lifecycle into Kubernetes
- Designed reusable infrastructure compositions

### Impact
- Unified infra + application workflows
- Improved reproducibility and automation
- Strengthened multi-cloud platform design skills
