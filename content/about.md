I work on systems where **uptime, latency, and scale matter**.

My approach to infrastructure and operations is practical and production-first:
- automate everything repeatable
- design systems assuming failure
- prefer boring, predictable solutions
- focus on observability and safe releases

Over time, I’ve worked extensively with **Kubernetes, cloud networking, GitOps, and CI/CD**, helping teams ship faster without compromising reliability.
